<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>The cluster management system we internally call Borg admits,schedules, starts, restarts, and monitors the full range of applications that Google runs. This paper explains how.Borg provides three main benefits: it (1) hides the details of resource management and failure handling so its users can focus on application development instead; (2) operates with very high reliability and availability, and supports applications
that do the same; and (3) lets us run workloads across tens of thousands of machines effectively. Borg is not the first system to address these issues, but it&#x2019;s one of the few operating at this scale, with this degree of resiliency and completeness. This paper is organized around these topics, concluding with a set of qualitative observations we have made from operating Borg in production for more than a decade.</p>
<h2 id="2-the-user-perspective">2. The user perspective</h2>
<p>Borg&#x2019;s users are Google developers and system administrators (site reliability engineers or SREs) that run Google&#x2019;s applications and services. Users submit their work to Borg in the form of jobs, each of which consists of one or more tasks that all run the same program (binary). Each job runs in one Borg cell, a set of machines that are managed as a unit. The remainder of this section describes the main features exposed in the user view of Borg.</p>
<h3 id="21-the-workload">2.1 The workload</h3>
<p>Borg cells run a heterogenous workload with two main parts. The first is long-running services that should &#x201C;never&#x201D; go down, and handle short-lived latency-sensitive requests (a few &#xB5;s to a few hundred ms). Such services are used for end-user-facing products such as Gmail, Google Docs, and web search, and for internal infrastructure services (e.g., BigTable). The second is batch jobs that take from a few seconds to a few days to complete; these are much less sensitive to short-term performance fluctuations. The workload
mix varies across cells, which run different mixes of applications depending on their major tenants (e.g., some cells are quite batch-intensive), and also varies over time: batch jobscome and go, and many end-user-facing service jobs see a diurnal usage pattern. Borg is required to handle all these cases equally well.</p>
<p>A representative Borg workload can be found in a publiclyavailable month-long trace from May 2011 [80], which has been extensively analyzed (e.g., [68] and [1, 26, 27, 57]).</p>
<p>Many application frameworks have been built on top of Borg over the last few years, including our internal MapReduce system [23], FlumeJava [18], Millwheel [3], and Pregel [59]. Most of these have a controller that submits a master job and one or more worker jobs; the first two play a similar role to YARN&#x2019;s application manager [76]. Our distributed storage systems such as GFS [34] and its successor CFS, Bigtable [19], and Megastore [8] all run on Borg.</p>
<p>For this paper, we classify higher-priority Borg jobs as &#x201C;production&#x201D; (prod) ones, and the rest as &#x201C;non-production&#x201D;(non-prod). Most long-running server jobs are prod; most batch jobs are non-prod. In a representative cell, prod jobs are allocated about 70% of the total CPU resources and represent
about 60% of the total CPU usage; they are allocated about 55% of the total memory and represent about 85% of the total memory usage. The discrepancies between allocation and usage will prove important in &#xA7;5.5.</p>
<h3 id="22-clusters-and-cells">2.2 Clusters and cells</h3>
<p>The machines in a cell belong to a single cluster, defined by the high-performance datacenter-scale network fabric that connects them. A cluster lives inside a single datacenter building, and a collection of buildings makes up a site.1 A cluster usually hosts one large cell and may have a few smaller-scale test or special-purpose cells. We assiduously avoid any single point of failure.</p>
<p>Our median cell size is about 10 k machines after excluding test cells; some are much larger. The machines in a cell are heterogeneous in many dimensions: sizes (CPU, RAM,disk, network), processor type, performance, and capabilities such as an external IP address or flash storage. Borg isolates
users from most of these differences by determining where in a cell to run tasks, allocating their resources, installing their programs and other dependencies, monitoring their health, and restarting them if they fail.</p>
<h3 id="23-jobs-and-tasks">2.3 Jobs and tasks</h3>
<p>A Borg job&#x2019;s properties include its name, owner, and the number of tasks it has. Jobs can have constraints to force its tasks to run on machines with particular attributes such as processor architecture, OS version, or an external IP address. Constraints can be hard or soft; the latter act like preferences rather than requirements. The start of a job can be deferred until a prior one finishes. A job runs in just one cell.</p>
<p>Each task maps to a set of Linux processes running in a container on a machine [62]. The vast majority of the Borg workload does not run inside virtual machines (VMs),because we don&#x2019;t want to pay the cost of virtualization. Also, the system was designed at a time when we had a considerable investment in processors with no virtualization support in hardware.</p>
<p>A task has properties too, such as its resource requirements and the task&#x2019;s index within the job. Most task properties are the same across all tasks in a job, but can be overridden &#x2013; e.g., to provide task-specific command-line flags. Each resource dimension (CPU cores, RAM, disk space,disk access rate, TCP ports,2
etc.) is specified independently at fine granularity; we don&#x2019;t impose fixed-sized buckets or slots (&#xA7;5.4). Borg programs are statically linked to reduce dependencies on their runtime environment, and structured
as packages of binaries and data files, whose installation is orchestrated by Borg.</p>
<p>Users operate on jobs by issuing remote procedure calls (RPCs) to Borg, most commonly from a command-line tool, other Borg jobs, or our monitoring systems (&#xA7;2.6). Most job descriptions are written in the declarative configuration language BCL. This is a variant of GCL [12], which generates
protobuf files [67], extended with some Borg-specific keywords. GCL provides lambda functions to allow calculations, and these are used by applications to adjust their configurations to their environment; tens of thousands of BCL files are over 1 k lines long, and we have accumulated tens of millions of lines of BCL. Borg job configurations have similarities to Aurora configuration files [6]. </p>
<p>Figure 2 illustrates the states that jobs and tasks go through during their lifetime.</p>
<p>A user can change the properties of some or all of the tasks in a running job by pushing a new job configuration to Borg, and then instructing Borg to update the tasks to the new specification. This acts as a lightweight, non-atomic transaction that can easily be undone until it is closed (committed). Updates are generally done in a rolling fashion, and a limit can be imposed on the number of task disruptions (reschedules or preemptions) an update causes; any changes that would cause more disruptions are skipped. Some task updates (e.g., pushing a new binary) will always require the task to be restarted; some (e.g., increasing resource requirements or changing constraints) might make the task no longer fit on the machine, and cause it to be stopped and rescheduled; and some (e.g., changing priority) can always be done without restarting or moving the task. Tasks can ask to be notified via a Unix SIGTERM signal
before they are preempted by a SIGKILL, so they have time to clean up, save state, finish any currently-executing requests, and decline new ones. The actual notice may be less if the preemptor sets a delay bound. In practice, a notice is delivered about 80% of the time.</p>
<h3 id="24-allocs">2.4 Allocs</h3>
<p>A Borg alloc (short for allocation) is a reserved set of resources on a machine in which one or more tasks can be run; the resources remain assigned whether or not they are used. Allocs can be used to set resources aside for future tasks, to retain resources between stopping a task and starting it again, and to gather tasks from different jobs onto the same machine &#x2013; e.g., a web server instance and an associated logsaver task that copies the server&#x2019;s URL logs from the local disk to a distributed file system. The resources of an alloc are treated in a similar way to the resources of a machine; multiple tasks running inside one share its resources. If an alloc must be relocated to another machine, its tasks are rescheduled with it.</p>
<p>An alloc set is like a job: it is a group of allocs that reserve resources on multiple machines. Once an alloc set has been created, one or more jobs can be submitted to run in it. For brevity, we will generally use &#x201C;task&#x201D; to refer to an alloc or a top-level task (one outside an alloc) and &#x201C;job&#x201D; to refer to a job or alloc set.</p>
<h3 id="25-priority-quota-and-admission-control">2.5 Priority, quota, and admission control</h3>
<p>What happens when more work shows up than can be accommodated? Our solutions for this are priority and quota.</p>
<p>Every job has a priority, a small positive integer. A highpriority task can obtain resources at the expense of a lowerpriority one, even if that involves preempting (killing) the latter. Borg defines non-overlapping priority bands for different uses, including (in decreasing-priority order): monitoring, production, batch, and best effort (also known as testing or free). For this paper, prod jobs are the ones in the monitoring and production bands.</p>
<p>Although a preempted task will often be rescheduled elsewhere in the cell, preemption cascades could occur if a high-priority task bumped out a slightly lower-priority one, which bumped out another slightly-lower priority task, and so on. To eliminate most of this, we disallow tasks in the production priority band to preempt one another. Finegrained priorities are still useful in other circumstances &#x2013;e.g., MapReduce master tasks run at a slightly higher priority than the workers they control, to improve their reliability.</p>
<p>Priority expresses relative importance for jobs that are running or waiting to run in a cell. Quota is used to decide which jobs to admit for scheduling. Quota is expressed as a vector of resource quantities (CPU, RAM, disk, etc.) at a given priority, for a period of time (typically months). The quantities specify the maximum amount of resources that a user&#x2019;s job requests can ask for at a time (e.g., &#x201C;20 TiB of RAM at prod priority from now until the end of July in cell xx&#x201D;). Quota-checking is part of admission control, not scheduling: jobs with insufficient quota are immediately rejected upon submission.</p>
<p>Higher-priority quota costs more than quota at lowerpriority. Production-priority quota is limited to the actual resources available in the cell, so that a user who submits a production-priority job that fits in their quota can expect it to run, modulo fragmentation and constraints. Even though we encourage users to purchase no more quota than they need, many users overbuy because it insulates them against future shortages when their application&#x2019;s user base grows. We respond to this by over-selling quota at lower-priority levels: every user has infinite quota at priority zero, although this is frequently hard to exercise because resources are oversubscribed. A low-priority job may be admitted but remain pending (unscheduled) due to insufficient resources.</p>
<p>Quota allocation is handled outside of Borg, and is intimately tied to our physical capacity planning, whose results are reflected in the price and availability of quota in different datacenters. User jobs are admitted only if they have sufficient quota at the required priority. The use of quota reduces the need for policies like Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) [29, 35, 36, 66].</p>
<p>Borg has a capability system that gives special privileges to some users; for example, allowing administrators to delete or modify any job in the cell, or allowing a user to access restricted kernel features or Borg behaviors such as disabling resource estimation (&#xA7;5.5) on their jobs.</p>
<h3 id="26-naming-and-monitoring">2.6 Naming and monitoring</h3>
<p>It&#x2019;s not enough to create and place tasks: a service&#x2019;s clients and other systems need to be able to find them, even after they are relocated to a new machine. To enable this, Borg creates a stable &#x201C;Borg name service&#x201D; (BNS) name for each task that includes the cell name, job name, and task number. Borg writes the task&#x2019;s hostname and port into a consistent,highly-available file in Chubby [14] with this name, which is used by our RPC system to find the task endpoint. The BNS name also forms the basis of the task&#x2019;s DNS name,
so the fiftieth task in job jfoo owned by user ubar in cell cc would be reachable via 50.jfoo.ubar.cc.borg.google.com. Borg also writes job size and task health information into Chubby whenever it changes, so load balancers can see where to route requests to.</p>
<p>Almost every task run under Borg contains a built-in HTTP server that publishes information about the health of the task and thousands of performance metrics (e.g., RPC latencies). Borg monitors the health-check URL and restarts tasks that do not respond promptly or return an HTTP error code. Other data is tracked by monitoring tools for dashboards and alerts on service level objective (SLO) violations.</p>
<p>A service called Sigma provides a web-based user interface (UI) through which a user can examine the state of all their jobs, a particular cell, or drill down to individual jobs and tasks to examine their resource behavior, detailed logs, execution history, and eventual fate. Our applications generate voluminous logs; these are automatically rotated to avoid running out of disk space, and preserved for a while after the
task&#x2019;s exit to assist with debugging. If a job is not running Borg provides a &#x201C;why pending?&#x201D; annotation, together with guidance on how to modify the job&#x2019;s resource requests to better fit the cell. We publish guidelines for &#x201C;conforming&#x201D; resource shapes that are likely to schedule easily.</p>
<p>Borg records all job submissions and task events, as well as detailed per-task resource usage information in Infrastore, a scalable read-only data store with an interactive SQL-like interface via Dremel [61]. This data is used for usage-based charging, debugging job and system failures, and long-term capacity planning. It also provided the data for the Google cluster workload trace [80].</p>
<p>All of these features help users to understand and debug the behavior of Borg and their jobs, and help our SREs manage a few tens of thousands of machines per person.</p>
<h2 id="3-borg-architecture">3. Borg architecture</h2>
<p>A Borg cell consists of a set of machines, a logically centralized controller called the Borgmaster, and an agent process called the Borglet that runs on each machine in a cell (see Figure 1). All components of Borg are written in C++.</p>
<h3 id="31-borgmaster">3.1 Borgmaster</h3>
<p>Each cell&#x2019;s Borgmaster consists of two processes: the main Borgmaster process and a separate scheduler (&#xA7;3.2). The main Borgmaster process handles client RPCs that either mutate state (e.g., create job) or provide read-only access to data (e.g., lookup job). It also manages state machines for all of the objects in the system (machines, tasks, allocs,etc.), communicates with the Borglets, and offers a web UI as a backup to Sigma.</p>
<p>The Borgmaster is logically a single process but is actuallyreplicated five times. Each replica maintains an inmemory copy of most of the state of the cell, and this state is also recorded in a highly-available, distributed, Paxos-based store [55] on the replicas&#x2019; local disks. A single elected master per cell serves both as the Paxos leader and the state mutator, handling all operations that change the cell&#x2019;s state, such as submitting a job or terminating a task on a machine. A master is elected (using Paxos) when the cell is</p>
